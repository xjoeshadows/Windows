- VPN-NetworkAdapterCheck.ps1: Helps improve opsec and accidental IP leaks if your VPN adapter is disconnected.. This script will check to see if a specific network adapter is connected, such as that of one being used by a VPN service before opening an app. If the adapter is disconnected, the script will prompt the user if they would still like to open the app.
